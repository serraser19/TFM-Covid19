# TFM-Covid19

The COVID-19 pandemic has generated one of the largest global crises in history. From the poorest countries to the great powers, all are experiencing an acute economic and health crisis.

Much has been said about the effects that this pandemic has had on the economy, social life, education and even on the mental health of the population. The vast majority of these studies were carried out in the first half of 2020, when information about the virus was still relatively unknown. In this moment of uncertainty, we want to take advantage of this opportunity to review the effects that COVID-19 has had on the European economy.


This Masterâ€™s Thesis has as its main objective to research the impact that the COVID-19 Pandemic has had on the European economies, as well as its consequences and causes, focusing specially on Spain, one of the most affected countries during the pandemic.
